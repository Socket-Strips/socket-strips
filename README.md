# Socket Strips

WIP

## Features

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).

## Deploy

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

## Notes

CURRENTLY `chalk, dotenv, socket.io, and winston` ARE INSTALLED OUTSIDE SO HEROKU WORKS, CHANGE THIS.

Find a way to not connect to socket until signed in (useSession doesn't work in _app)

Don't allow users to perform socket actions if not identified?
