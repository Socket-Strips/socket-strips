# Socket Strips

WIP

## Features

See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md).


## Deploy

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

## Notes

* Add info about the git submodules and how to contribute, also how [the prisma repo **HAS** to be public](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/4566#discussioncomment-125253).

* Find a way to not connect to socket until signed in (useSession doesn't work in _app)

* Don't allow users to perform socket actions if not identified?
